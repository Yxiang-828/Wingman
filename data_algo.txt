📊 Optimized Week-Based Task Fetching Algorithm
🧠 Core Strategy
The goal is to reduce API calls and memory usage while ensuring a responsive UI. This is done by:

Fetching and caching one week at a time

Using a lightweight format for standard display

Fetching full task details only when necessary

Automatically managing memory by cleaning up old cached weeks

🔄 PHASE 1: Navigating to a Week
Step 1: Determine the Week ID
When the user navigates to a date (e.g., May 25, 2025), determine the Sunday of that week.

Use this Sunday date as a unique identifier for the week (weekId).

Step 2: Check if Week is Already Cached
Look in your cache to see if data for this weekId already exists.

If it's in the cache and recent, use it directly.

Step 3: If Not Cached, Fetch It
Make a single API call to fetch tasks from Sunday to Saturday of that week.

Only request essential fields needed for display (e.g., id, title, date, time, urgency).

Store this in a memory cache (e.g., a Map keyed by weekId).

Step 4: Display Tasks in UI
Render the lightweight task list per day in the week view from the cache.

Ensure updates or changes to task data are synced into this structure.

🧾 PHASE 2: Viewing Task Details
Step 1: User Clicks a Task
When a user selects or clicks a task for more info, trigger a detail fetch.

Step 2: Check if Full Details Are Already Loaded
If this task’s full info is already present (e.g., previously opened), skip the fetch.

Step 3: Fetch Full Task Details (On-Demand)
Call the backend to get the full task data (including description, notes, tags, etc.).

Cache this result locally for subsequent views.

🧹 PHASE 3: Smart Cache Management
Step 1: Keep the Most Recent 5 Weeks
Keep a rolling window of 5 cached weeks (current week ± 2 weeks before/after).

This ensures fast navigation near the current date.

Step 2: Clean Up Old Data
If more than 5 weeks are cached, remove the oldest (least recently accessed).

Use a Least Recently Used (LRU) or timestamp-based cleanup policy.

📈 Benefits
2 API calls/week max (one for list, one per occasional detail popup)

Snappy UI performance due to reduced fetches

Efficient memory usage via smart week-based caching

Scalable to large numbers of users and tasks


#################################SUGGESTED IMPLEMENTATION###################
📊 Enhanced Week-Based Task Fetching Algorithm v2.0
🧠 Core Strategy Evolution

The enhanced algorithm reduces API calls from 14-19 per week to 1 per week while maintaining
zero UI changes and implementing predictive caching for seamless user experience.

## 🔄 PHASE 1: Intelligent Week Navigation

### Step 1: Enhanced Week ID Generation
```typescript
const getWeekId = (date: Date): string => {
  const sunday = new Date(date);
  sunday.setDate(date.getDate() - date.getDay());
  return `${sunday.getFullYear()}-W${getWeekNumber(sunday)}`;
};
```

### Step 2: LRU Cache with Current Week Protection
```typescript
interface WeekCache {
  data: Map<string, WeekData>;           // LRU-managed cache
  currentWeek: string;                   // Protected from LRU eviction
  maxSize: 5;                           // 5-week rolling window
  
  get(weekId: string): WeekData | null;  // Auto-promotes to most recent
  set(weekId: string, data: WeekData);   // Manages size automatically
  protectCurrentWeek(weekId: string);    // Prevents current week eviction
}
```

### Step 3: Week Data Fetching Strategy
**Backend Optimization:**
```python
@router.get("/api/v1/week/{week_id}/data")
async def get_week_data(week_id: str, user_id: str):
    # Single optimized query for ALL week data
    week_start, week_end = calculate_week_bounds(week_id)
    
    # Lightweight response - only essential fields
    tasks = supabase.table("tasks").select(
        "id, title, task_date, task_time, urgency_level, completed, status"
    ).gte("task_date", week_start).lte("task_date", week_end).eq("user_id", user_id)
    
    events = supabase.table("calendar_events").select(
        "id, title, event_date, event_time, type"
    ).gte("event_date", week_start).lte("event_date", week_end).eq("user_id", user_id)
    
    diary = supabase.table("diary_entries").select(
        "id, title, entry_date, mood"
    ).gte("entry_date", week_start).lte("entry_date", week_end).eq("user_id", user_id)
    
    return WeekDataResponse(
        weekId=week_id,
        tasks=tasks.data,
        events=events.data,
        diary=diary.data,
        cached_at=datetime.now().isoformat()
    )
```

## 🧾 PHASE 2: Smart Detail Loading & Mutations

### Step 1: On-Demand Detail Fetching
```typescript
const getTaskDetails = async (taskId: string): Promise<FullTask> => {
  // Check if already in detailed cache
  if (detailCache.has(taskId)) {
    return detailCache.get(taskId);
  }
  
  // Fetch full task details only when needed
  const response = await apiClient.get(`/api/v1/tasks/${taskId}/details`);
  detailCache.set(taskId, response.data);
  return response.data;
};
```

### Step 2: Optimistic Updates with Rollback
```typescript
const updateTask = async (taskId: string, updates: Partial<Task>) => {
  // 1. Update cache immediately (optimistic)
  const weekId = getWeekIdFromTask(taskId);
  const weekData = weekCache.get(weekId);
  updateTaskInCache(weekData, taskId, updates);
  
  try {
    // 2. Send update to backend
    const response = await apiClient.patch(`/api/v1/tasks/${taskId}`, updates);
    
    // 3. Confirm cache with server response
    updateTaskInCache(weekData, taskId, response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    // 4. Rollback on failure
    rollbackTaskInCache(weekData, taskId);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## 🧹 PHASE 3: Enhanced Cache Management

### Step 1: Current Week Protection
```typescript
const protectCurrentWeek = (currentWeekId: string) => {
  weekCache.currentWeek = currentWeekId;
  
  // Current week never gets evicted from LRU
  weekCache.cleanup = function() {
    this.data.forEach((data, weekId) => {
      if (weekId === this.currentWeek) return; // Skip current week
      
      const cacheAge = Date.now() - new Date(data.cached_at).getTime();
      if (cacheAge > 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 || this.data.size > this.maxSize) {
        this.data.delete(weekId);
      }
    });
  };
};
```

### Step 2: Predictive Adjacent Week Preloading
```typescript
const preloadAdjacentWeeks = async (currentWeekId: string) => {
  const { prevWeek, nextWeek } = getAdjacentWeekIds(currentWeekId);
  
  // Preload previous and next week in background
  const preloadPromises = [prevWeek, nextWeek].map(async (weekId) => {
    if (!weekCache.get(weekId)) {
      try {
        const weekData = await fetchWeekData(weekId);
        weekCache.set(weekId, weekData);
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(`Preload failed for ${weekId}:`, error);
      }
    }
  });
  
  // Non-blocking background preload
  Promise.all(preloadPromises);
};
```

### Step 3: Smart Cache Invalidation
```typescript
const invalidateWeekCache = (affectedDate: Date) => {
  const weekId = getWeekId(affectedDate);
  
  // Remove only the affected week, keep others
  weekCache.data.delete(weekId);
  
  // Trigger refresh if it's the current week
  if (weekId === weekCache.currentWeek) {
    fetchWeekData(weekId).then(data => weekCache.set(weekId, data));
  }
};
```
