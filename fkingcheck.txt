### 🧠 Generalized Copilot Prompting Strategy for Context + Performance Issues

1. **Find the relevant file:**

   ```
   Locate the file where this component or feature is implemented.
   ```

2. **Read the contents:**

   ```
   Show me the code inside that file so I can understand how it’s structured and what it depends on.
   ```

3. **Analyze context usage:**

   ```
   Identify where and how any context provider or consumer is used in this component. Is it deeply nested, passed around, or triggering rerenders?
   ```

4. **Spot performance red flags:**

   ```
   Point out any potential performance issues here — excessive re-renders, state bloat, overuse of context, or unnecessary recalculations.
   ```

5. **Outline a refactor strategy:**

   ```
   Suggest a cleaner or more efficient way to structure this component, with minimal changes, to address the performance concerns you identified.
   ```

6. **Generate improved implementation:**

   ```
   Rewrite the key parts of the component using that improved strategy. Make it scalable and easy to maintain.
   ```

7. **Testing and validation:**

   ```
   What tests or validations should I do to confirm this refactor doesn't break functionality and actually improves performance?
   ```

8. **Performance benchmarking:**

   ```
   How can I benchmark this component before and after the changes to quantify performance gains (e.g., render counts, interaction delay)?
   ```

🧠 DEBUGGING STRATEGY & BLIND SPOTS
-----------------------------------

REASON: Full-stack apps fail where two worlds meet—catch assumptions early.

COMMON BLIND SPOTS TO CHECK
- [ ] Frontend ↔ Backend endpoint mismatch
- [ ] CORS or preflight errors
- [ ] Async race conditions
- [ ] `useEffect` dependencies
- [ ] API error not shown in UI
- [ ] Dev vs Prod config divergence
- [ ] Supabase RLS policy silently rejecting
- [ ] `console.log()` overload
- [ ] Linting or TS errors ignored
- [ ] State invalidation not triggering re-render
- [ ] Timezones and date handling
- [ ] Electron preload leaks

PREVENTION BEST PRACTICES
- [ ] Add explicit error boundaries in React
- [ ] Use `try/catch` with descriptive error logs
- [ ] Trace each API call with loading + error state
- [ ] Test on both dev and production builds
- [ ] Add API schema validators (Zod/Pydantic)
- [ ] Mock backend responses for frontend testing
- [ ] Define `eslint` and `prettier` rules
- [ ] Run regular dependency audits (`npm audit`, `pip check`)
- [ ] Enable `strict` in `tsconfig.json`
